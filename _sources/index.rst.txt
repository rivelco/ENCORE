EnsemblesGUI documentation
==========================

Graphic User Interface to perform a variety of neuronal ensembles identification's methods using calcium or electrical recordings.

.. note::
   This project is under current development.

This GUI currently incorporates five different algorithms:

- SVD based method: Carrillo-Reid, et al. "Endogenous sequential cortical activity evoked by visual stimuli." Journal of Neuroscience 35.23 (2015): 8813-8828.
- PCA based method: Herzog et al. 2021 "Scalable and accurate automated method for neuronal ensemble detection in spiking neural networks. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34329314/ Rubén Herzog Dec 2021
- ICA based method: Lopes-dos-Santos V, Ribeiro S, Tort AB (2013) Detecting cell assemblies in large neuronal populations. J Neurosci Methods 220(2):149-66. 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2013.04.010
- Xsembles2P method: Pérez-Ortega, J., Akrouh, A. & Yuste, R. 2024. Stimulus encoding by specific inactivation of cortical neurons. Nat Commun 15, 3192. doi: 10.1038/s41467-024-47515-x
- Similarity Graph Clustering method: L. Avitan et al. "Spontaneous Activity in the Zebrafish Tectum Reorganizes over Development and Is Influenced by Visual Experience". Curr. Biol. 27 (2017). DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2017.06.056
